Dark times have fallen upon the Telerik Alpha Academy...

Evil alien invaders have attacked the academy and taken hold of it! They
have also taken hostage the trainers as well as the students of the academy.

Unfortunately, the invaders have programmed their warships to instantly attack
anybody who tries to enter the academy grounds.

Using your awesome programming skills, you have managed to breach their
system's security and steal one of their flagships. Now, the only thing you
have to do is navigate the ship and destroy the capital ship of the aliens
in order to free the academy of this vicious enemy.

Good luck!
